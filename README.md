## 🧾 Project Description

The **Portfolio Website** is a fully responsive and animated web application that acts as a digital identity for me as a developer. It features a visually rich and engaging layout, smooth transitions, and modular components that highlight:

- ✅ **Who I am** – A brief bio, my passions, and goals.
- 🛠️ **What I do** – A clean display of my core skills and technologies.
- 💼 **What I’ve built** – A section for real-world projects with descriptions and links.
- 📬 **How to reach me** – Integrated contact section and social media links.
- 🎯 **Polish** – Animations, transitions, and custom cursor effects for a seamless UX.

This project was built to not only demonstrate my technical capabilities but also to serve as a central hub for potential employers, clients, and collaborators.

Whether you're viewing it on desktop, tablet, or mobile — it delivers a consistent, elegant experience.
